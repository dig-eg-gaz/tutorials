Hi. I'm John, and I'm about to list out the steps to create a template. I'm assuming you have the Oxygen XML Editor, and that you know how to use it. I'll begin
listing the necessary steps.

1. Have Oxygen XML open.
2. Have a well-formed XML document, i.e., not too many horrific errors that prevent you from opening it in author mode. I can't help you if you have those errors.
3. Make sure you have the necessary div, head, and p settings already established.
4. If you have a functional, well-formed XML file/document, open it in Author mode. You can do it without Author mode, but it's inconvenient like nothing else.
5. If you have it properly set up, you should look to the top-right of the file, and click on the blue/white rectangular icon. The one that will have a description of "Insert a table."
6. Something should pop up saying "Insert table", with options to give a Head, row number, and column number.
7. Rows are vertical, columns are sideways.
8. From here, just label it however you need it labeled. Once you have the table opened up, with your specifications placed in, the additional tools are fairly elementary to use.
