1. The first step of the analysis project is to develop a serial question. It can be about anything in the Egyptian Gazette that
interests you and you want to learn more about. 
2. Next, you want to turn this question into an X-Path query to be able to search the Egyptian Gazette for the topic you want to learn more
about. Specify where you want to search (page, section, item, etc.) and what you want to search, normally a word or words. An example of an
X-Path query would be: //div[@type="item"][contains(., 'CRICKET')] if you wanted to search all "items" for the word "CRICKET" (this is case
sensitive).
3. Decide which XML files you want to search, and open them up in the Oxygen XML editor. Find the X-Path query box in the top left corner
and put your query here. If you want to search the entire content 
repository, use Oxygen's project function to open a new project, and right click to add a folder of the content repository you have copied
on your computer. Then change the icon at the left edge of the query box to search project.
4. The results of search will show up at the bottom. Simply double click on each result individually to see them. 
5. After you have read through your results and have some answers to your serial question, simply write a Markdown text of approximately 
1500 words. Don't forget to include graphs or tables for engaging data visualization.
