###Getting Started

When signed into a Google account, people can access the Google Maps program and create their own custom maps. To access this feature, click on the "Menu" button and go down to tab that says "Your Places". Once there, you can click on the "Maps" section and create new maps or edit any existing maps.

If you wish to create a new map, click on "Create Map"

If you want to work on a pre-existing map, just click on the name of the map you want to edit. These will be located above the "Create Map" option.

###Working With Maps

To name or rename a map, click on the name of the map which may be "Untitled map" if starting with something fresh. Once you're ready to start adding your data to the map, you can use the search bar to pinpoint a place and the "Add Marker" tool under the search bar to leave pins at locations of interest. After you drop a marker, you can name it, add a description and even attach images and videos to that point.

If you are working with multiple points and wish to show the movements of people or goods for example, you can connect them using the "Draw a Line" tool. Simple select the tool, click where you would like your line to start, click at each place you want it to intersect and then double click at the final point. After double clicking, you can name, describe and attach additional media, just like with the map markers.

All of your points and lines created can be organized and categorized into different layers. Layers are useful because they help with simplifying dense maps and addressing subjects separately. The items within one layer will appear as a different color than the items in other layers. To add new layers, click on "Add Layer" and once a new layer has been created, you drag For example, if your map shows the routes of both planes and cars, you can place the points for each into separate layers and then toggle the layers to view just plane routes, just car routes, both, or neither. To toggle a layer just click the check box next to the name of the layer. Layers can be renamed by either clicking on the name, or clicking "layer options" where you can also delete the selected layer or open a data table that features the points in that layer. The items within each layer can be organized in various ways by changing how you would like to group the places in the layer and how you would like to name them. This feature can be accessed by clicking on the small paint roller beneath the layer title.

When logged into your Google account, you don't have to worry about actively saving any changes that you make to your maps. Once you are finished working, just exit out of the tab and your work will automatically be saved. If you wish to go back and view or edit maps later on, return to the beginning of this tutorial.
