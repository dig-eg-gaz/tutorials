In order to get started TEI tagging the text of the Egyptian Gazette,
it is necessary to first understand the importance of TEI. So far, the
XML has provided us with a raw version of the text of the newspaper.
However, in order to put this content into a format conducive to the
class webpage, the text must be tagged.

For the content of the Egyptian Gazette, it is most important to tag
certain structures. For example, divisions help to separate different
sections or articles of the paper. Paragraphs, headers, and divisions
should all be tagged, along with place names and people names, in order
to allow for further analysis.

To tag a specific body of text, simply open Oxygen or another software
and highlight the text you wish to tag. Input Command+E and a box will
pop up on the screen. In this box, specify which tag you wish to input.
For example, division would be "div," paragraph would be "p," headers
would be "head," place names would be "placeName," and person names
would be "persName." 

In the text, a header will be wrapped as <head>"Insert header here"</div>.
This helps to wrap the content and put it in a format the computer
can understand. There are many different tags that can be used for a
variety of purposes, depending on your needs. Happy tagging!
