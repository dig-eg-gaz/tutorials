# Advertisements

In terms of the Egyptian Gazette, advertisements are featured for things like hotels, ships, and soap. The first page of the newspaper is where most of these reside, but you will find them scattered throughout the rest. There are a long list of reoccurring advertisements that have already been made into [templates](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/advertisements/#hbh01-halls-boars-head).

# Alexandria

Located in Egypt, this is where the Egyptian Gazette is based out of. It is a coastal large city in the north.

# Analysis Project

This is the final project due for this class. You’ll be using you and your classmate’s work of transcribing the newspaper to complete this.  It involves creating a serial question and asking that question using XML to all issues of the newspaper. You can do your project on whatever interests you. A question could be “What was the role of donkeys as represented by the <i>Egyptian Gazette</i>?” “How did the prices of Cotton fluctuate in New York?” “How many tons of grains were shipped daily throughout the year? How did they fluctuate?”.  Examples of the projects can be found [here](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/analysis).

# Boilerplates

When the <i>Egyptian Gazette</i> was originally produced, the typesetters would save time by creating physical templates for reoccurring ads and tables to save time when printing the paper. Many of these boilerplates have been created in XML form, to save you time too.
