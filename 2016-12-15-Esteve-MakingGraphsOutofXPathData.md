###Creating Tables in Microsoft Word  

After saving XPath data and opening it in Microsoft Word, find and click the Replace option under the Editing section of the Home tab.

First, type in ^p^p and replace all with ^p. Then, click the No Spacing option. For this specific set of data, replace .xml, Description:, .html, and System ID: C:\Users\Justin\Desktop\Digital Microhistory\Content\content\ with nothing. This will delete all of the information that isn't needed for the table.  

After replacing text, highlight all of the data. Then click the Insert tab and Table. Click Convert Text to Table, and in this case, change the number of columns to 2. This should set up a completed table, then highlight the top row and click Insert Above to add a title to the table. The finished table should look like this:

###Inputting Tables into Excel  

Once you copy the data and paste it into Excel, highlight it and click on the Insert Tab. Then, click PivotTable and click ok. This should create a screen like this:

Check the boxes in the PivotTable Fields section on the right of the screen. This will order all of the individual days into months. This won't be that useful for other types of information, but PivotTables are great for numbers. Finally, highlight the PivotTable and click on the Insert tab, then on PivotChart.

This should be the final product. There are many other ways to use data from XPath, but PivotTable is a useful tool to do so.
