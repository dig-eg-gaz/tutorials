This guide will teach you how to get all of your page one's done in one sitting. Come into this ready to work. Put on some music grab your favorite source of caffeine, and you will get 1/6 of your pages done today.

Note: You must have your page images already, if not do that first

So page one for each day consists of advertisements. If you compare all your page one's for your week you will notice a lot, and I mean a lot of similarities. Use this to your advantage. Start out on your first day page one. Find every single advertisement using ctrl+f on the lists of advertisements on the course site. Paste these in order onto your page one. Do not forget to add column breaks using `<cb></cb>`, and do not forget the hidden advertisements at the top of the page. After you have all that pasted in bring up the image of page one, and your xml text side by side on your computer. The next step is by far the most arduous part. Fix all the numbers, any words that are different, and any other discrepancies you find between your image and the template.

When you are done with that, take a little breather things are going to get much easier. Keep your first, perfected, page up on oxygen now open your day 2 page 1. Just like you did for the first one paste all of the advertisements in order with column breaks where necessary. Check for similarities between the first and second page. Any advertisement that shows up in the previous day should be pasted from your perfected xml text not the website template as the numbers tend to be pretty similar. When you have all the text do not check for accuracy move on and repeat the step with all page one's. Each page is likely to have the same advertisement as another page check within your xml files before pasting a template from a website.

By now you should be done with all page one's atleast with the pastings. Now go back through and page by page check and correct all numbers and words. If you relied on your previous pages for pasting, the numbers are likely already correct, but check anyways. It should take just a cursory glance at each advertisment to check to make sure they are correct.

This whole thing if done all the way through should not last more than 4-5 hours. If you do not want to do all the work today, that is completely fine just make sure you rely on your previous pages it will make things exponentially easier.

Takeaways:
Rely on day 1 page 1 for pasting to expedite the process
Do not correct day 2-day6 page ones right away wait until you are done pasting the general layout
General Tip-Do not procrastinate split up your work and get it done, work by groups of pages not days
