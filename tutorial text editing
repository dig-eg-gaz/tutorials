#Text Editing Tips
A primary component of this course involves changing [microfilm](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/microfilm-instructions/) into readable text. The microfilm readers in the library will help you get pictures, but the pictures themselves can be tricky when going through the OCR reader. The easiest way to combat this problem is to take four quarter pictures of the pages filled with text and then stitch them together (the application to stitch them together is on the computers with the microfilm readers in Strozier). If you have enough patience working with this and want the editing to be easier on you later on, you can also take pictures in eighths. The OCR reader should have an easier time clearly reading this text.
Once you have stitched the pictures together and transferred them to your laptop, put them through [OCR])https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/OCR-instructions/) and let the application run. Then export to TextEdit or Word and just read through everything. Check for common errors- the letter c often gets confused with o, the letter n often gets confused with u- and change these before pasting them into Oxygen. The more experience you have reading the text, the faster you’ll be able to get through it and have a better idea of what is actually being said. Note: deselect the parts of the page you don’t want to go through the OCR reader, such as advertisements and data tables. These will only clog up the text you have to sort through. Try to only keep articles highlighted before you export to the text editor.
Once the text is cleaned up, it has to move over to Oxygen. When Oxygen is in author mode, it will do some of the formatting for you (if you paste the text _directly_ into author mode). However, if you kept all the line breaks in your text editor, Oxygen will treat each line as a new paragraph. It might be better to paste the text into Oxygen while still in text mode and then add the paragraph breaks as they are supposed to appear.
