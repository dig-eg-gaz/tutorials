author: Dante Grieco

1. The first step for running a query on your desired XML files is to first
determine the scope of your search. Decide which XML files you want to search
and then open them in the Oxygen XML editor.
2. You will now locate the XPath query box in the top left corner of Oxygen. If
you wish, you may open the XPath/XQuery Builder by clicking the //* symbol on
the far right of the XPath query box.
3. You can now search through your XML file(s) using a query that will return a
list of elements at the bottom of Oxygen. For example, searching //div in the
query box or XQuery Builder will return all the "divs" in the scope of XML files
searched.
4. Search through your elements list at the bottom of Oxygen to find the specific
element that will lead you to your desired piece of information.
